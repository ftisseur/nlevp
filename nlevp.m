%NLEVP   Collection of nonlinear eigenvalue problems.
%  [COEFFS,FUN,OUT3,OUT4,...] = NLEVP(NAME,ARG1,ARG2,...)
%    generates the matrices and functions defining the problem specified by
%    NAME (a case insensitive string).
%    ARG1, ARG2,... are problem-specific input arguments.
%    All problems are of the form
%      T(lambda)*x = 0
%    where
%      T(lambda)= f0(lambda)*A0 + f1(lambda)*A1 + ... + fk(lambda)*Ak.
%    The matrices A0, A1, ..., Ak are returned in a cell array:
%    COEFFS = {A0,...,Ak}.
%    FUN is a function handle that can be used to evaluate the functions
%    f1(lambda),...,fk(lambda).  For a scalar lambda,
%    F = FUN(lambda) returns a row vector containing
%      F = [f1(lambda), f2(lambda), ..., fk(lambda)].
%    If lambda is a column vector, FUN(lambda) returns a row per element in
%    lambda.
%    [F,FP] = FUN(lambda) also returns the derivatives
%      FP = [f1'(lambda), f2'(lambda), ..., fk'(lambda)].
%    [F,FP,FPP,FPPP,...] = FUN(lambda) also returns higher derivatives.
%    OUT3, OUT4, ... are additional problem-specific output arguments.
%    See the list below for the available problems.
%
%  PROBLEMS = NLEVP('query','problems') or NLEVP QUERY PROBLEMS
%    returns a cell array containing the names of all problems
%    in the collection.
%  NLEVP('help','name') or NLEVP HELP NAME
%    gives additional information on problem NAME, including number and
%    meaning of input/output arguments.
%  NLEVP('query','name') or NLEVP QUERY NAME
%    returns a cell array containing the properties of the problem NAME.
%  PROPERTIES = NLEVP('query','properties') or NLEVP QUERY PROPERTIES
%    returns the properties used to classify problems in the collection.
%  NLEVP('query',property1,property2,...) or NLEVP QUERY PROPERTY1 ...
%    lists the names of all problems having all the specified properties.
%
%  [T,TP,TPP,...] = NLEVP('eval',NAME,LAMBDA,ARG1,ARG2,...)
%  evaluates the matrix function T and its derivatives TP, TPP,...
%  for problem NAME at the scalar LAMBDA.
%
%  NLEVP('version') or NLEVP VERSION
%    prints version, release date, and number of problems
%    of the installed NLEVP collection.
%  V = NLEVP('version')
%    returns a structure V containing version information.
%    V consists of the fields v.number, v.date, and v.problemcount.
